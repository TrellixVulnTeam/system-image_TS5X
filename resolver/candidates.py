    This function returns a list of candidate upgrades paths, from the
    current build number to the latest build available in the index
    file.

    Each element of this list of candidates is itself a list of `Image`
    objects, in the order that they should be applied to upgrade the
    device.

    The upgrade candidate chains are not sorted, ordered, or prioritized
    in any way.  They are simply the list of upgrades that will satisfy
    the requirements.  It is possible that there are no upgrade candidates if
    the device is already at the latest build, or if the device is at a build
    too old to update.

    :param index: The index of available upgrades.
    :type index: An `Index`
    :param build: The build version number that the device is currently at.
    :type build: str
    :return: list-of-lists of upgrade paths.  The empty list is returned if
        there are no candidate paths.
