# We want to support {}-style logging for all systemimage child loggers.  One
# way to do this is with a LogRecord factory, but to play nice with third
# party loggers which might be using %-style, we have to make sure that we use
# the default factory for everything else.
#
# This actually isn't the best way to do this because it still makes a global
# change and we don't know how this will interact with other third party
# loggers.  A marginally better way to do this is to pass class instances to
# the logging calls.  Those instances would have a __str__() method that does
# the .format() conversion.  The problem with that is that it's a bit less
# convenient to make the logging calls because you can't pass strings
# directly.  One such suggestion at <http://tinyurl.com/pjjwjxq> is to import
# the class as __ (i.e. double underscore) so your logging calls would look
# like: log.error(__('Message with {} {}'), foo, bar)
