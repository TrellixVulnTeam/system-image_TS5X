    The keyring .tar.xz file and its signature file are downloaded.  The
    signature is verified against the keys in the signature keyring gpg
    file.  If this fails, a SignatureError is raised and the files are
    deleted.

    If this succeeds, the tar.xz is unpacked, which should produce a
    keyring.gpg file containing the keyring, and a keyring.json file
    describing the keyring.  We load up the json file and verify that
    the keyring 'type' matches the type parameter and that the 'expiry'
    key, which names a UTC UNIX epoch timestamp, has not yet expired.
    Also, the 'model' key is checked - it is optional in the json file,
    and when it's missing, it means it applies to any model.

    If any of these condition occurred, a KeyringError is raised and the
    files are deleted.

    Assuming everything checks out, the .gpg file is copied to the cache
    location for the unpacked keyring, and the downloaded .tar.xz and
    .tar.xz.asc files are moved into place.  All the other ancillary
    files are deleted.

        one of 'archive-master', 'image-master', 'image-signing',

        .tar.xz file (in which case the url to the associated .asc file will
        be calculated), or a 2-tuple naming the .tar.xz and .tar.xz.asc files.
    :param sigkr: The local keyring file that should be used to verify the
        downloaded signature.
    :param blacklist: When given, this is the signature blacklist file.
    :raises SignatureError: when the keyring signature does not match.
    :raises KeyringError: when any of the other verifying attributes of the
        downloaded keyring fails.
