# LP: #1240106 - We get intermittent and unreproducible TimeoutErrors in the
# DEP 8 when the default timeout is used.  It seems like cranking this up to
# 20 minutes makes the tests pass.  This must be some weird interaction
# between ubuntu-download-manager and the autopkgtest environment because a
# TimeoutError means we don't hear from u-d-m for 10 minutes... at all!  No
# signals of any kind.  It's possible this is related to LP: #1240157 in
# u-d-m, but as that won't likely get fixed for Saucy, this is a hack that
# allows the DEP 8 tests to increase the timeout and hopefully succeed.
